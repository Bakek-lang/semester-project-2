# Auction House

Auction House is a fully functional auction web application where users can list items for auction, place bids, and view profiles of other users. The project is built using TailwindCSS, HTML, and vanilla JavaScript and is part of the Semester Project 2 assignment for a school project. The application interacts with an existing API and focuses on the front-end implementation.

# Project Overview

Auction House allows users with a stud.noroff.no email address to register, log in, create, bid, and delete auction listings. Users can also update their avatars and bios, and view the profile of others, including their auction listings.

# Features

- **User Registration and Login:** Users can register with a stud.noroff.no email and log in to their account.
- **Create Auction Listings:** Users can create new listings by adding a title, description, image and deadline for the auction.
- **Bidding System:** Users can place bids on other users' listings, and when the auction ends, the highest bidder is displayed as the winner.
- **Profile Pages:** Users can view their profile and othersâ€™ profiles, which display avatar, username, bio, and all active or expired listings.
- **Settings:** Users can update their avatar and bio through the settings page.
- **Search:** Even unregistered users can search through auction listings.
- **Logout:** Users can securely log out and will lose access to other pages except for the home, login, and register pages.
